## General

Any contributions are welcome, from a simple bug report to full-blown new modules:

If you **find a bug** and don't have the time or in-depth knowledge to fix it, just [check if you can add info to an existing issue](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/issues) and otherwise [file a bug report](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/issues/new/choose) with as many infos as possible.
If you want to contribute fixes, documentation or new code, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/compare).


If you want to contribute and don't know where to start, have a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/issues/3).



## Making a PR

If you are new to the GitHub Fork & Pull Request Workflow, please read [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and/or [this](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) guide first. Below we summarize details that are specific to **rust-bio**.

### Creating A Branch

You have two options to do this:
1. For one-time contributions, simply [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository, apply your changes to a branch in your fork and then open a pull request.
2. If you plan on contributing more than once, become a contributor by saying hi in the [`Join the team!` issue](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio/issues/27) or [on the `rust-bio` Discord server](https://discord.gg/rssQABT).
    We'll add you to the team.
    Then, you don't have to create a fork, but can simply push new branches into the main repository and open pull requests there.

### Install pre-commit hooks

**If you want to contribute more than once, we strongly suggest you install pre-commit hooks.** To do so:

1. [Follow the instructions](https://pre-commit.com) to install `pre-commit` if you haven't yet. (if you have `pip`, just `pip install pre-commit`)
2. Nagivate to `rust-bio`'s project directory, and run `pre-commit install`. This should update `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

After hooks have been installed, several checks specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will be run every time you want to commit. In most cases, if any test fails, the hook will try to fix the problem automatically, and then you can commit your changes together with changes made by the hook.

If you need to bypass the hook, use `git commit -n`.

### Applying Changes

Please follow our [style guidelines](#style-guidelines).

### Merging

Once you submit your pull request on GitHub, several automated tests should be run, and their results reported on the pull request.

`cargo test`, `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` must be passed before a PR can be merged. This is why we strongly suggest installing pre-commit hooks which warn you about any issues in advance

## Style Guidelines

Every public function and module should have [documentation comments](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html).
Check out [which types of comments to use where](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/comments.html#doc-comments).
In `rust-bio`, documentation comments should:
* [explain functionality](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html)
* give at least one useful example of how to use it (best as [doctests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html),
  that run during testing, and using descriptive [`expect()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect)
  statements for handling any `Err()`s that might occur)
* describe time and memory complexity listed (where applicable)
* cite and link sources and explanations for data structures, algorithms or code (where applicable)

For extra credit, feel free to familiarize yourself with:
* the Rust [documentation conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.html#appendix-a-full-conventions-text)
* the Rust [API documentation guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html)

### Bypassing Formatting Warnings

Formatting warnings emitted by `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` can be bypassed using the attribute `#[allow(<rule_name>)]`. Where you absolutely need to do so, please justify. For example:

```
#![allow(non_snake_case)]
// I, D, S are conventionally used for scoring matrices.
// Only one row of the matrices are stored, i.e. I, D, S are Vec<_> instead of Vec<Vec<_>> or similar.
// In addition, single-character variable names are abundant.
// Therefore, using uppercase letter helps to better signify their meaning.
#![allow(clippy::many_single_char_names)]
// Due to the strategy used by this set of algorithms, some variables have different meanings under different
// contexts, for example: `let mut s: i32; // S[i - 1][j - 1] (before updating S[i][j]) or S[i][j - 1] (after updating S[i][j])`
// Therefore, it is difficult to give them unchanged and descriptive names.
// The meanings of these variable names are explained in `Aligner.global`
```
