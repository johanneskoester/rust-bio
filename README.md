# Rust-Bio, a bioinformatics library for Rust.

This library provides implementations of many algorithms and data structures
that are useful for bioinformatics.
All provided implementations are rigorously tested via continuous
integration.

**Please see the [homepage](https://rust-bio.github.io) for examples and documentation.**

Currently, rust-bio provides

* most major pattern matching algorithms,
* a convenient alphabet implementation,
* pairwise alignment,
* suffix arrays,
* BWT and FM-Index,
* FMD-Index for finding supermaximal exact matches,
* a q-gram index,
* utilities to work with [PSSMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix),
* an orf research algorithm,
* a rank/select data structure,
* [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) support for all data structures when built with `nightly` feature,
* FASTQ and FASTA and BED readers and writers,
* helper functions for combinatorics and dealing with log probabilities.
